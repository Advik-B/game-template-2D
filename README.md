# Game template 2D

This is a basic template for making SFML games in C++
I made this template because I often find myself writing the same, boring-ass CMake files

# Installation (for development)

Or simple download the source code via `git clone` or Pressing [![image](https://github.com/Advik-B/game-template-2D/assets/86160411/a6f85505-d063-46f2-b798-03f085f93d7e)](https://github.com/Advik-B/game-template-2D/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and *download zip*

Unzip your files into a folder
The folder sturcture should look like this:
```
game-template-2D
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ .idea/* (we dont care about this for now)
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Window.cpp
â””â”€â”€ include
    â””â”€â”€ Window.hpp
```


Open any shell of your choice

<details>
  <summary>Note for windows users (click to expand)</summary>
  When using windows
  
  MAKE SURE TO USE <b>DEVELOPER COMMAND PROMPT/DEVELOPER POWERSHELL</b> for this step
</details>

Navigate to the project folder and make a build folder

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

And generate CMake

<details>
  <summary>Note for windows users (click to expand)</summary>
  If you have mingw installed, make sure to add
  
  ```
  -DCMAKE_IGNORE_PATH=D:\Path\to\mingw
  ```
  
  So that it dosent use mingw in the compilation process 
</details>

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja ..
```

If you have any issues with until now, then go back and retry
If you still have issues, open an [issue ticket via github](https://github.com/Advik-B/game-template-2D/issues/new)

Finally, we get to the exceiting part

run the build command, in the same directory you generated the cmake files
```
cmake --build . --config Release
```

If everything goes well ðŸ¤ž...

You should have an executable in:
```
bin/Release
```
( I am assuming you are in the `game-template-2D/build` directory already )

Run the executable `bin/Release` (warning, flashing colours)

It should display a window similar to this

Happy Developing

# Compilers

Here is a list of compilers that are reccomended by me for the respective os
| OS | Compiler |
|----|----------|
| Windows | MSVC |
| Mac | clang/g++ |
| Linux | g++ |

## Warning

DO NOT, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD USE MINGW ON WINDOWS

IT WILL RUN FINE ON YOUR PC/Laptop BUT IT WILL INTRODUCE MANY MORE PROBLEMS WHEN YOU DISTRUBUTE YOUR PROGRAM

Use Visual Studio compiler from microsoft instead, you will be doing yourslef a favour
